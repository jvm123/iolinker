  "body": "# iolinker\r\n\r\n## The iolinker Chips\r\nEvery iolinker chip functions as a dynamically configurable IO matrix. Its main functionality,\r\nbesides IO extension, is to dynamically set up a matrix of GPIO connections, that allow direct\r\n(or inverted) pass-through of high-frequency signals. Circuits can thereby be configured and\r\nprogrammed on the fly. There are UART / SPI / I2C versions that allow for easy integration\r\nof up to 127 chips connected in parallel. Pro versions also allow for PWM signal output.\r\n\r\n## The iolinker Library\r\n\r\nThe iolinker library allows easy interfacing of the iolinker chips, on a PC, a Raspberry Pi or on an Arduino. It works with UART, SPI and I2C chips.\r\n\r\n##  Dependencies\r\n* WiringPi on Raspberry\r\n\r\n",
