## The iolinker Chips

Every iolinker chip functions as a dynamically configurable IO matrix. Its main functionality, besides IO extension, is to dynamically set up a matrix of GPIO connections, that allow direct (or inverted) pass-through of high-frequency signals. Circuits can thereby be configured and programmed on the fly. There are UART / SPI / I2C versions that allow for easy integration of up to 127 chips connected in parallel. Pro versions also allow for PWM signal output.

## The iolinker Library

The iolinker library allows easy interfacing of the iolinker chips, on a PC, a Raspberry Pi or on an Arduino. It works with UART, SPI and I2C chips.
